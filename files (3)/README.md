# Project cards & Owner image — Instructions

What to do with your uploaded photo:
1. Save the image you uploaded in this chat as: assets/owner.jpg
   - Recommended: 300×300 (square), jpeg or webp.
2. Add (or replace) project cover images as:
   - assets/project1.jpg
   - assets/project2.jpg
   - assets/project3.jpg
   Use landscape images ~1200×800 for best results.

Files included above:
- projects.html — updated page that shows project cards with a cover image, title, description and an owner avatar overlay (uses assets/owner.jpg).
- gallery.html — updated gallery that includes your owner image inside the gallery grid and shows a visible "Owner" badge.
- styles-additions.css — CSS additions to handle owner badges, card cover sizing, and gallery badge.
- script-additions.js — small JS to enhance accessibility and fallback behavior.

Notes about privacy & identity:
- I cannot identify or confirm who is in a photo. I will treat the image you provided as the owner avatar for display on your site, but I will not (and cannot) confirm the person's identity.

How to apply:
1. Put the provided files into your project folder (or merge the styles and script additions into your existing files).
2. Place the image file at assets/owner.jpg.
3. Open projects.html and gallery.html in your browser to verify layout.
4. Replace placeholder cover images with your preferred images.

If you want:
- I can generate HTML for many projects automatically from a JSON file (projects.json) or from a simple CSV — tell me how many project entries and I will scaffold that.
- Or I can push these files to a GitHub repo for you (I can create a repo under your account pupydoky20081-pixel) — say "push to GitHub" and provide the repo name or let me create one for you.
